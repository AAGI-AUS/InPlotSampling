Description: The InPlotSampling package provides a way for researchers
    to easily implement Ranked Set Sampling in practice.  Ranked Set
    Sampling was originally described by McIntyre (1952) (reprinted in
    2005) <doi:10.1198/000313005X54180>. This package takes work by Omer
    and Kravchuk (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-021-00439-1> and
    enables easy use of the methods.
