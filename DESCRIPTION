Description: The RankedSetSampling package provides a way for researchers to easily implement Ranked Set Sampling in practice.
    Ranked Set Sampling was originally described by McIntyre (1952) (reprinted in 2005) <doi:10.1198/000313005X54180>. This package takes
    work by Omer and Kravchuk (2021) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-021-00439-1> and enables easy use of the methods.
